<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The purpose of our mobile application is to use reminiscence therapy to enhance the quality of everyday life of people with dementia (PWD) by helping them recall moments of their past and the times spent with close friends, family members, and caregivers. Reminiscence therapy improves the quality of life in PWD by reducing stress, increasing their self-esteem and helping them reconnect with memories of their life. Our application aims to achieve these benefits along with reducing cognitive decline by challenging users to recognise randomly chosen images of individuals or memorabilia and strengthen connections with memories pertaining to these individuals or memorabilia through questions presented in the application.

The application will allow users to upload photos, videos, audios, and create questions that help recollect who or what the photo is about to develop a deeper connection to the image. The application will use these images, videos, audios and questions to create an exercise for people with dementia in the hopes of providing reminiscence therapy to them. The videos will play after the user has answered all the question in a question set and then will move onto the next question set with the new image, video and new audio files for each of the questions in a question set.
